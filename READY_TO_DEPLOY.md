- Add PostgreSQL database addon
- Set environment variables (secure SECRET_KEY provided)
- Wait for deployment and health checks

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment to Vercel (10-15 minutes)
**Follow guide**: `.superdesign/design_iterations/frontend-deployment-guide.md`

**Key Points:**
- Create project with root directory `sic_app`
- Set `VITE_API_URL` to your Render backend URL
- Auto-detects Vite configuration
- Deploy and verify connection to backend

### Step 4: Email Configuration (10-15 minutes)
**Follow guide**: `.superdesign/design_iterations/email-setup-guide.md`
