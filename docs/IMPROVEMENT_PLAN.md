# DueSpark Improvement Plan (Updated & Prioritized)

Generated: 2025-09-15
Last Updated: 2025-09-17

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Post-Phase 2 mobile-first transformation complete. TypeScript build now passes, but backend tests remain broken and security vulnerabilities persist.

**Impact**: Backend test suite still fails to collect, and exposed secrets plus security scan findings block production readiness.

**Priority**: Address must-fix blockers immediately to restore stability, then systematic technical debt reduction.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (Fixed During Analysis)

### Frontend: File Corruption ✅
- ✅ **Fixed**: Converted literal "\\n" sequences to real newlines in `sic_app/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts`
- ✅ **Verified**: File now compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ **Impact**: Core performance monitoring functionality restored

### Frontend: TypeScript Compilation Crisis ✅
- ✅ **Fixed**: Replaced ad-hoc response typing with shared interfaces, cleaned Stripe/manual mutations, and updated onboarding tests to use `createMockUser`
- ✅ **Verified**: `npm run type-check` now completes successfully; build is unblocked
- ✅ **Impact**: Restores baseline type safety for onboarding and settings workflows so future refactors can rely on compiler checks

### Frontend: ESLint Dependency Conflicts ✅
- ✅ **Fixed**: Locked tooling to `eslint@8` with matching plugins; lint command executes without peer/version errors under Node 18
- ✅ **Verified**: `npm run lint` runs to completion, surfaced only code-level violations
- ⚠️ **Follow-on**: Large backlog of lint rule failures remains to be addressed separately

## 🚨 MUST (Critical Blockers - Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Backend: Test Infrastructure Broken
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Core suites still red, but Stripe + billing tests now pass (39 tests)
**Priority**: #1

**Recent Progress**:
- ✅ Updated `test_phase3_implementation.py` to build a service via `create_subscription_service`
- ✅ Removed duplicate `test_ai_heuristics.py` causing pytest import mismatch (collection now succeeds)
- ✅ Rebuilt Stripe webhook handler + tests (`tests/test_stripe_webhooks.py` now 16/16 green)
- ✅ Implemented real subscription checkout/portal/pause logic; `tests/test_subscription_billing.py` now 23/23 green
- ✅ Scheduler reminder suite aligned with new limit rules (`tests/test_scheduler.py` now 7/7 green)
- ✅ Referral reward/credit flows migrated to dollar-based accounting; `tests/test_referrals.py` now 28/28 green
- ✅ Modernized subscription unit tests; `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_subscription_service_unit.py` now 14/14 green
- ✅ Full backend suite executed (`PYTHONPATH=. pytest`); 198/198 tests now passing

**Outstanding Failures** (examples):
- *(none – backend suite is green)*

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Completed 2025-09-17: Rotated Stripe keys and rolled out the shared secrets playbook across Render, Fly.io, and GitHub Actions environments.
2. ✅ Integrate Bandit into CI and add security regression checks to guardrails (backend-ci now fails when Bandit finds issues)
3. ✅ Add SOPS helper tooling (`scripts/secrets/decrypt.sh`, `secrets/README.md`) to support forthcoming pipeline
4. 🔁 Regression coverage: Added subscription pause/resume and scheduler reminder regressions to the suite; continue adding targeted tests alongside bug fixes.
5. 🔁 Suite guardrail: Schedule weekly `PYTHONPATH=. pytest` runs and track pass/fail trends in the Ops dashboard.

### 2. Security: Exposed Secrets in VCS
**Status**: 🟢 RESOLVED – Keys rotated and secrets now sourced through the shared SOPS/Vault workflow
**Priority**: #2

**Found**:
```bash
# Historical state (pre-remediation)
/.env
/sic_app/.env
/sic_backend_mvp_jwt_sqlite/.env

# Example leakage (redacted):
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_************************
```

**Resolution**:
1. ✅ Remove committed `.env` files (replace with sanitized `.env.example` guidance)
2. ✅ Confirm `.gitignore` blocks `.env*` variants across workspace
3. ✅ Ensure `.env.example` templates exist with placeholder values only
4. ✅ Coordinate Stripe key rotation (test + live keys regenerated, legacy keys revoked 2025-09-17)
5. ✅ Adopt shared secrets management playbook (Vault/SOPS workflow live for Stripe + webhook secrets)

**Secrets Management Action Items (Owner: DevOps, Target: 2025-09-24)**
- ✅ Evaluate HashiCorp Vault Cloud vs. Mozilla SOPS + git-crypt for multi-environment key storage (see `docs/SECRETS_DECISION.md`, draft 2025-09-17).
- ✅ Prototype chosen solution with Stripe/Webhook secrets and add CI pipelines (Render, Fly.io, GitHub Actions) to consume secrets via that channel (rolled out 2025-09-17).
- ✅ Scaffold SOPS tooling (`scripts/secrets/decrypt.sh`, `.sops.yaml`, `secrets/README.md`) ahead of prototype rollout.
- ✅ Document onboarding steps for developers (how to fetch secrets locally, rotation workflow, access policies) — see `docs/SECRETS.md` (draft v0.1).

**Stripe Key Rotation Playbook (Owner: Payments/Platform, Target: 2025-09-18)**
- ✅ Inventory existing Stripe test & live secret keys (`sk_…`) referenced in Render/Fly.io/CI and current `.env` deployments (owners: Payments & DevOps).
- ✅ Generate new keys in the Stripe Dashboard; store them in the agreed secrets manager (Vault/SOPS) and update deployment pipelines (Render, Fly.io, Vercel, GitHub Actions).
- ✅ Execute maintenance window (2025-09-17) to deploy updated secrets, then re-run smoke tests (`PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_stripe_webhooks.py` + checkout/portal flows) to confirm connectivity.
- ✅ Revoke compromised keys immediately after verifying the new ones were live in all environments.
- ✅ Document the rotation (date, keys rotated, owners) and add a quarterly reminder in the Ops calendar (next rotation due 2025-12-17).

📌 **Follow-up**: Secrets council to review rotation logs during the October ops sync.

### 3. Security: Bandit Scanner Findings
**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Low-risk findings remain
**Priority**: #3

**Current Scan (`bandit -r app` 2025-09-17)**:
- ✅ Resolved prior HIGH (B701 – enforced Jinja2 autoescape in `app/email_templates.py`)
- ✅ Remaining LOW items cleared (scheduler/outbox logging now surfaces failures with context)

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Integrate Bandit into CI so regressions fail fast (backend-ci.yml updated 2025-09-17)
2. 🔁 Quarterly audit cadence established for broad exception handling (first session booked for 2025-09-24 release cut).
3. ✅ Documented logging/error-handling guidelines and shared with engineering (handbook updated 2025-09-17).

**Remaining Low-Risk Themes**:
- Establish coding patterns to avoid future `try/except/pass` anti-patterns
- Review legacy MD5 helper usage as part of cryptography hardening (tracked separately)
- Align secrets-management rollout with Ops (reminders for quarterly key reviews)

## 🔧 SHOULD (Short-term Technical Debt - Within 2 Weeks)

### Code Quality & Standards
**Priority**: Post-blocker resolution

1. **Python Code Formatting**
   - ✅ Black applied across the backend repository (2025-09-17) and added to the `format-python` make target.
   - ✅ isort configured with the Black profile; pre-commit hook enforces import ordering on commit.
   - ✅ CI now fails fast on formatting drift via `ci/backend-quality.yml`.

2. **TypeScript Code Quality**
   - ✅ Enabled stricter compiler options (`strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) and wired them into CI.
   - ✅ Consolidated API response typings in `sic_app/src/types/api.ts`; downstream consumers updated.
   - ✅ Error boundary typing: Dashboard shell now wraps with typed fallback via `AppLayout` error boundary (landed 2025-09-17).

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Pytest collection back to 100% with the latest suite passing (198/198).
   - ✅ Coverage threshold locked at 85%; latest CI artifact reports 87.4%.
   - ✅ New fixtures for Phase 2 mobile flows merged (`sic_app/e2e/fixtures/mobile.ts` + navigation specs updated 2025-09-17) with weekly mobile QA cadence documented in `sic_app/e2e/README.md`; `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` now runs the mobile suite on nightly schedules.

### CI/CD Reliability
1. **Build Pipeline Stability**
   - ✅ Code Quality job now mirrors lint/test outcomes and blocks on failure.
   - ✅ Required documentation gate checks ADR/runbook presence before merge.
   - ✅ Added nightly `pip-audit` and `npm audit` jobs with Slack notifications for actionable issues.

2. **Security Scanning Integration**
   - ✅ Trivy container scanning added to publish pipeline with MEDIUM+ severity breakglass policy.
   - 🔁 Automated dependency updates enabled via Renovatebot; monitor noise over the next sprint.
   - ✅ JavaScript/TypeScript SAST coverage added through CodeQL on default branch pushes/PRs.

3. **Dependency Triage Process**
   - ✅ Weekly Renovate rotation codified (`docs/DEPENDENCY_TRIAGE.md`) with owners, labels, and escalation rules.
   - ✅ Auto-merge policy defined for safe patch updates; major updates require architecture review sign-off.
   - 🔁 Observe traffic for two weeks and refine grouping rules to further reduce PR volume if necessary.

### Configuration Management
1. **Settings Centralization**
   - ✅ Adopted `pydantic-settings` for backend configuration with environment validation at startup.
   - ✅ Missing required variables now halt boot with actionable error messaging.
   - ✅ Environment handbook updated with a canonical configuration matrix (dev/staging/prod).

2. **Logging & Observability**
   - ✅ Replaced legacy `print()` statements with structured logging (structlog) across services.
   - ✅ Integrated Sentry DSN delivery via secrets manager; staging alert tested 2025-09-17.
   - 🔁 Audit ancillary scripts for log level/format consistency during Week 3 observability push (seed_admin.py + init_db.py + migrate_existing_credits.py + populate_demo_data.py migrated 2025-09-17; migration playbook drafted).

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **None at present** – critical security remediation completed 2025-09-17; continue monitoring through quarterly reviews.

### Medium Risk
- **Mobile fixture drift** – Mitigated via nightly GitHub Actions job (`mobile-tests`) running shared mobile fixtures and weekly QA checklist; continue monitoring fixture coverage as new endpoints ship.
- **Observability gaps** – Remaining ancillary scripts progressively moving to structured logging; dashboard upgrades scheduled Week 3 (populate_demo_data now aligned).
- **Dependency update noise** – Weekly triage rotation active; evaluate Renovate grouping metrics after two weeks to confirm PR volume drop.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Security sustainment**: Enforce quarterly secrets rotation reviews and alerting on anomalies.
2. **Execution focus**: Deliver Week 3 observability/fixture commitments before expanding scope.
3. **Process hardening**: Establish dependency triage rota and merge guardrails before enabling auto-merge.

## 📞 Implementation Support Required

### Resources Needed
- **1 Senior Frontend Developer**: Error boundary typing + performance budget enforcement (2-3 days).
- **1 QA/Automation Engineer**: Phase 2 fixture expansion and coverage uplift (2 days).
- **1 DevOps Engineer**: Observability sprint (structured logging audit, dashboarding) (3 days).

### Critical Dependencies
- **Observability Vendor Decision**: Grafana Cloud vs. Datadog evaluation must conclude before Week 5 rollout.
- **Ops Calendar Alignment**: Quarterly secrets review + dependency triage schedule require leadership sign-off.
- **Service Decomposition RFC**: Architecture guild approval needed to unlock Week 3 implementation work.
