# DueSpark Operational Readiness Report

Generated: 2025-09-15

## Executive Summary

- Status: Partially ready. Core infrastructure, CI, and docs are strong; several critical issues block production readiness.
- Key blockers:
  - Frontend TypeScript file(s) contain literal "\n" characters instead of real newlines, breaking type-check/build (`sic_app/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts:1`).
  - Frontend ESLint 9 conflicts with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.6.2`, causing `npm ci` to fail.
  - Backend tests fail during collection due to API mismatch (tests import `subscription_service` but module exports `get_subscription_service`).
  - Secrets committed to VCS (`.env` contains Stripe test keys). Keys must be rotated and file removed from repo history.
- Strengths:
  - Clear monorepo layout with backend (`FastAPI`), frontend (Vite + React + TS), infra (Docker, Compose), and docs (Docusaurus).
  - Robust CI suite for code quality, unit/integration and E2E testing, plus deploy docs and monitoring stack.
  - Pre-commit, Dependabot, Bandit, Safety (planned), and coverage gates configured.

## Scope and Method

- Reviewed repository structure, configs, and key code paths.
- Ran backend static checks (Black, isort, Flake8, MyPy), Bandit, and attempted tests.
- Attempted frontend install, type-check, and lint.
- Reviewed container, Compose, and CI workflows; skimmed runbooks and deployment docs.

Evidence: See “Validation Evidence” at the end.

## Readiness by Area

### Architecture & Code Quality

- Backend (Python/FastAPI):
  - Black/isort: Many files would be reformatted; imports out of order across app and tests.
  - Flake8: Numerous docstring/import/whitespace violations; not production blocking but indicates drift from standards.
  - MyPy: Current config leads to 1k+ errors (tests and app). Either config isn’t being applied as intended or strictness is too high vs. codebase typing level.
  - Structure: Single `app` module with services/routes; Alembic present; good separation but some large modules could be split.

- Frontend (Vite/React/TS):
  - TypeScript: At least one file is corrupted with literal "\n" sequences; type-check fails early.
  - Linting: `eslint@^9` conflicts with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^4.6.2`; install fails.
  - Tests: Vitest configured; E2E with Playwright set up in CI; didn’t run locally due to install blocker.

### Security

- Secrets management:
  - Critical: `.env` is checked in with Stripe test keys. Must be removed and keys rotated. Use `.env.example` only and Render/Fly/CI secrets for runtime.
- Static analysis (Bandit on backend):
  - B701: `Jinja2` environment with `autoescape=False` can permit XSS.
  - B324: MD5 used for IDs/cache keys; use `hashlib.md5(..., usedforsecurity=False)` or switch to SHA-256 for non-security identifiers.
  - B110: Multiple `try/except/pass` blocks; replace with targeted exceptions and logging.
- Dependencies:
  - Python deps pinned; good for reproducibility. Safety install conflicts in dev set; replace with `pip-audit` or upgrade Safety; keep automated updates via Dependabot (present).
  - Node deps have peer dependency mismatch (ESLint 9 vs plugin); fix versions to restore supply-chain checks and linting.

### Testing & Quality Gates

- Backend tests: Fail during collection due to import API mismatch in `subscription_service` expected by tests.
- Coverage: Config targets 85% but cannot be validated until tests run.
- Pre-commit: Well-configured, though ESLint/Prettier are skipped in CI and may fail locally due to npm conflicts.

### Build & Release

- Docker: Multi-stage production Dockerfile uses non-root user and healthcheck. Dev Dockerfile is reasonable. Consider image digest pinning and Trivy scans (Makefile target exists).
- Compose: App + Postgres with healthchecks, test service wired to DB; good. Consider `.env` for secrets (no clear-text in compose).
- CI/CD: Multiple workflows (backend, frontend, e2e, quality gate). “Quality Gate Summary” prints static “Passed” regardless of failures; make it reflect job outcomes.

### Infrastructure & Operations

- Render and Fly.io configs present with sensible env var scaffolding, healthchecks, and scaling knobs.
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana stack provided via compose; backend exports Prometheus metrics; good foundation.
- Runbooks & secrets docs exist. Add incident response basics (pager policy, escalation matrix) if moving to production.

### Observability & Logging

- Logging: Some `print()` in request paths and exception swallowing. Adopt `logging` with structured JSON logs and error reporting (Sentry DSN provided via env, not yet wired everywhere).
- Metrics: `prometheus_client` in deps; ensure request metrics, DB latency, job scheduler metrics are consistently exported.

### Data & Migrations

- Alembic configured; DB URL defaults to SQLite but production uses Postgres. Ensure all migrations are idempotent and verified against Postgres.
- No PII redaction strategy documented; define data retention/DSAR and auditing for invoice/client data.

### Documentation & Developer Experience

- Docusaurus docs site is present with setup and deployment guides.
- Missing docs referenced by CI: `docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md` not found (CI will fail).
- Makefile: helpful targets; duplicate `test` target names (two definitions) – unify.

## Priority Improvements

Must (Blockers):
- Remove `.env` from the repo; rotate all keys; rely on `.env.example` and secrets in deploy/CI.
- Fix corrupted TS files with literal "\\n" sequences. Replace with real newlines; run `npm run type-check` and `npm run build` until green.
- Resolve ESLint peer conflicts: either downgrade to `eslint@^8` or upgrade plugins compatible with ESLint 9; align Node/TypeScript versions with CI.
- Backend test import fix: export `subscription_service` (module-level instance or re-export of `get_subscription_service`) or update tests accordingly so `pytest` collects and runs.
- Address Bandit high findings:
  - Enable `autoescape=True` for Jinja2 templates.
  - Remove `try/except/pass` patterns in `app/main.py` and elsewhere with proper exception handling/logging.
  - Replace MD5 usages for identifiers or mark `usedforsecurity=False` when safe.

Should (Short-term hardening):
- Apply Black/isort across backend and update CI to fail on drift; do the same for frontend (Prettier).
- Narrow MyPy scope to app modules first (exclude `tests/` initially). Gradually raise strictness per-module.
- Make “Quality Gate Summary” reflect actual job results in CI; add status aggregation or use GitHub Checks outputs.
- Add `pip-audit` or fix Safety dependency, and `npm audit --omit=dev` to CI.
- Standardize config via `pydantic-settings` in backend; validate required env vars at startup.
- Replace ad-hoc prints with structured logs; ensure error handlers capture and return sanitized messages.
- Add Trivy scan to CI for built images (Makefile target exists, wire it to CI).

Could (Medium-term):
- Extract large service modules into smaller units; add domain boundaries and interfaces.
- Introduce background job queue (e.g., RQ/Celery) if scheduler workloads grow; use Redis as backing store (currently optional).
- Add SLOs, error budgets, and a simple on-call rotation doc.
- Add OpenAPI contract tests and contract publish step in CI.

## Validation Evidence (commands and outcomes)

- Backend formatting/lint/type-check:
  - `black --check .` → 62 files would be reformatted.
  - `isort --check-only .` → many files with incorrect import order.
  - `flake8 .` → extensive docstring/import/whitespace findings.
  - `mypy .` (with repo config) → >1k errors; likely scope/strictness mismatch vs codebase.
- Backend tests: `pytest -q` → collection errors: cannot import `subscription_service` from `app.subscription_service`.
- Bandit (`bandit -r app -f json`): high severity B701 (Jinja2 autoescape=False), B324 (MD5), many B110 try/except/pass occurrences.
- Frontend:
  - `npm ci` → fails due to ESLint 9 vs `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.6.2` peer conflict.
  - `npm run type-check` → fails on `sic_app/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts` due to literal `\n` characters.
- CI/Docs: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml` expects `docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md` (missing) and prints a static passing summary regardless of actual failures.

## Suggested Acceptance Criteria to Reach “Ready”

- All of “Must” items completed.
- Backend: `black --check`, `isort --check-only`, `flake8`, `mypy` (scoped to app) pass; `pytest` runs with ≥85% coverage.
- Frontend: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run build` pass.
- CI: Code-quality job reflects real outcomes; security scans run and upload artifacts; docs job passes.
- Secrets: No real secrets in repo; `.env.example` maintained; deploy secrets injected at runtime.

If you’d like, I can implement the “Must” fixes in a follow-up PR (scoped, atomic commits), starting with the frontend corruption and the backend test import contract.
